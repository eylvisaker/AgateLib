This example shows how to handle user input using the 
`GamepadInputHandler` object.

This input handler will map keyboard events to inputs onto
a gamepad model that resembles the button structure for XInput
controllers.

The code in this example shows how one can inspect the
gamepad state. The `IGamepad` object also has events that can
be subscribed to when the user pressed buttons or moves the stick.
