This folder contains some older SDL.NET implementation software I wrote.

SDL.NET was abandoned as a driver for Agate because it does not support scaling or rotation of images.  This might provide a nice starting place for systems which do not support 3D acceleration (GP32X, anyone?).  But many of these systems may not have enough memory and processing power to run Linux and Mono.

Some files appear to be missing???
