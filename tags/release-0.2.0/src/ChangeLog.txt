
Current Changes
===================
* Added a BitmapFontImpl class, to handle bitmap fonts.
* Added FontSurface.BitmapMonospace method to create a monospace bitmap font.
* Added Surface.DrawRects, it was mistakenly missing.
* Added Keyboard.AnyKeyPressed to check to see if the user has hit a key.  
* Added StringTransformer class to allow FontSurfaces to transform strings before they are drawn.
* Added the Serializable attribute to Point, PointF, Rectangle, RectangleF, Size, SizeF structures.
* Added some code to make the Registrar a little more robust, if non .NET dll's are present.
* Added Timing.StopWatch.IsPaused as a read-only property.
* Added Object.Equals overrides in Point and Size structures.
* Added operator == and operator != in Point, Size and Rectangle structures.
* Added DisplayWindow constructor overloads that allow specification of a .ico file for the window icon.

* Renamed Keyboard.ClearAllKeys to Keyboard.ReleaseAllKeys.  Old version is there, but deprecated.
* Changed Keyboard.ReleaseAllKeys to call an internal KeyState method.
* Changed behavior of Keyboard.ReleaseAllKeys to mark keys which are already depressed so that KeyDown events are not generated for them until the are physically released.

* Fixed a bug in AgateMDX.Surface.DrawRects which was from using TriangleStrips instead of TriangleLists, and updated it to use the DrawBuffer.
* Fixed a bug where SoundBuffer and Music objects weren't using the FileManager search paths.
* Fixed a bug where Display.AutoPause would cause the program to go in an infinite loop and never exit when the window was closed.
* Fixed a bug where a NullReferenceException would occur if a new Music object was created and failed to open the media file, and then was subsequently finalized. 
* Corrected version information in AgateDrawing and AgateMDX.
* Fixed SpriteTester and SurfaceTester to work with Mono.
