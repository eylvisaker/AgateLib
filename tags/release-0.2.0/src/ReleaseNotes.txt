AgateLib 0.2.0  Release Notes
======================================

Deployment issues, I think are resolved.  In order to develop with AgateLib, it is recommended
that you have a .NET 2.0 development environment (such as Visual C# Express 2005 or SharpDevelop 2.0).
If you are developing a game, your game only needs references to mscorlib, System.DLL, and AgateLib.dll.
No reference to System.Drawing.dll or System.Windows.Forms.dll is required.

If you're developing a game authoring tool, your application should be developed using System.Windows.Forms.
You can develop an application with a rich user interface and instruct AgateLib to render to multiple 
child controls by creating DisplayWindows for each of those controls and changing the Display.RenderTarget
to them.

If you want to deploy an application using AgateLib, of course you need to make sure that a client machine
has the .NET 2.0 framework installed.  At the moment, the only hardware acceleration supported is provided by
Managed DirectX.  As such you must also make sure that the client machine has the DirectX 9.0c runtime
install.  The files required for the June 2006 MDX update are in the dxredist folder in the AgateLib source
trunk.  These must also be installed on the client machine.  This can be done silently during the setup procedure
according to Microsoft.

Known Issues:
* Doesn't run under Linux right now.
* No hardware acceleration support in Mono.



AgateLib 0.1.8 Release Notes
======================================

Requires .NET 2.0 or Mono.

Deployment procedure, with respect to DirectX runtime files is unknown at the moment.  I 
have included what I think is the minimum required files for the DirectX runtime distributable
to work with the AgateMDX library in the dxredist directory of the archives.

Known Issues:
* VSync is not properly supported in the Direct3D driver.
* There's a problem with Display.PackAllSurfaces where it does not copy surfaces correctly.
* Direct3D driver does not work with Mono.  If you are running in Mono, delete AgateMDX.dll from your application directory.
