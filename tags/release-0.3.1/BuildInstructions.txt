AgateLib Build instructions
===========================

In the Build folder is a collection of scripts built around the .NET Prebuild project 
located at http://dnpb.sf.net/ which are used to generate project and solution files
for various IDE's.  The following scripts are supported:
 * VS2008.bat : Create project files for Visual Studio 2008.
 * monodevelop.sh : Create project files for MonoDevevelop. 
       You may need to use "chmod +x monodevelop.sh" in order to run the monodevelop
       script file.

Once one of the above scripts is run, project and solutions will be created.  
The solution files will all be placed in the Builddirectory.  Project files for 
each AgateLib driver, tool and test are created in their respective source 
directorys.  It is recommended that you try to build the AgateLib solution
before trying the others.

Solution file descriptions
--------------------------

Solution files end in either .sln (Visual Studio) or .mds (MonoDevelop).
The following solutions are generated.

AgateLib : This solution contains the project for creating the AgateLib.dll file, as
           well as supported driver libraries that can be built on any platform.  These
           include AgateOTK.dll, AgateFMOD.dll, AgateLib.WinForms.dll, and AgateDrawing.dll.

AgateLib-Windows : This solution is identical to the AgateLib solution, except it will also
           contain projects which can only be built on Windows such as AgateMDX.dll.
           
AgateTools : This solution will contain all the development tools that are packaged with
           AgateLib.
           
*Tests: Solutions who's names end with "Tests" contain small applications designed to test
           certain areas of AgateLib.  These projects also can be useful as example code.
