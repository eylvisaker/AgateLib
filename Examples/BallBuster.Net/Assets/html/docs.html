Ball: Buster's Source Code</div>
<div class="t">

Full source code, including a Visual C++ 6 workspace, can be found in the Ball: Buster root directory. In order to compile, you will need Clanlib, found at 
http://clanlib.org<br>
If you port this game, or do anything "interesting", Please let me know! I would gladly put a link to whatever creation you've made from my website. I've found time 
and again, that people like to port games, or distribute games, or mod games, and never tell their original authors.
