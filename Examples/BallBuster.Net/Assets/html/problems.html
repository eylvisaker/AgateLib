Having Technical Trouble Playing Ball: Buster?</div>
<div class="t">
Restarting windows will cure the most common Ball: Buster problems. Restarting windows may or may not cure the following symptoms:<br>
• Choppy Gameplay<br>
• Choppy Sound<br>
• Unexplained "crashing"<br>
• Any other unexplained problems<br>
<br><br>
Please note that you MUST have a video card capable of openGL accelerated graphics to run this game. If you have a capable video card, but 
still do not get good performance, update your drivers! Updating your video card's drivers is VERY important if you plan to play video games. 
Please check your card's manufacturer's site.

As with all software, there is an absolute gigantic number of things that can go wrong, being that every computer set up
(usually drastically) differs. When a restart doesn't fix problems, it's usually safe to point your finger at your computer's
hardware. I'd recommend at least a 733mhz CPU, 96MB of Ram, and a relatively modern GPU (32MB or better most likely). Also
make sure you are indeed using a windows computer (95,98,ME,NT,2k,2k3, or XP+) or Linux. At the time of this writing, this game is not 
available for other operating systems, however you are welcome to port the source code (and Clanlib it's self) yourself.
