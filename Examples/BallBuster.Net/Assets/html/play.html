			How to Play Ball: Buster</div>
		<DIV class="t">Ball: Buster, is your typical "Breakout" style game, in which your 
			goal is to destroy blocks by bouncing a ball at them. You begin the game with 
			control of a paddle, and two extra lives. When the level begins, there is a 
			ball 'stuck' to your paddle. You can either click your mouse, or wait 5 
			seconds, and the ball will be launched upward.
		</DIV>
		<DIV class="t">&nbsp;</DIV>
		<DIV class="t">If the ball hits a block, it will damage or destroy it and will 
			bounce in the opposite direction.
		</DIV>
		<DIV class="t">If the ball hits a wall, it will bounce in the opposite direction.
		</DIV>
		<DIV class="t">You can get extra balls by obtaining some powerups (see powerups 
			section).&nbsp; When you have multiple balls, they can collide with each 
			other.&nbsp;
		</DIV>
		<DIV class="t">&nbsp;</DIV>
		<DIV class="t">
			Blocks take between 1 and&nbsp;3 hits to destroy. Each hit that does not 
			destroy a block is worth 2 points, and breaking a block is worth 10 
			points.&nbsp; The level is over when you've destroyed all blocks, except for 
			the steel ones. You will lose a life if all balls fall below the paddle. Once 
			you lose all of your lives, the game is over. The paddle is controlled by 
			moving your mouse left and right.
			<br>
			<br>
			The list of effective powerups is shown at the right side of the screen, and 
			the number of remaining lives is shown below there.&nbsp; Your score is shown 
			on the lower-left hand corner of the screen.&nbsp; Try to rack up as many 
			points as possible to beat your friends' high scores.&nbsp;&nbsp;Getting 
			powerups that make the game easier will lower the amount of points you gain for 
			breaking and hitting blocks.&nbsp; Challenge yourself!&nbsp; You can gain many 
			more points that way.</DIV>
		<DIV class="t">&nbsp;</DIV>
		<DIV class="t">Bonus points are also awarded when a level is completed.&nbsp; 500 
			points are awarded for completing the level, and up to 300 points can be 
			awarded for finishing the level quickly.&nbsp; Additionally, if you complete 
			the level without losing a single ball, there is a bonus of 500 points, and if 
			you complete the level without getting any powerups at all (excluding point 
			bonuses), there is a 1500 point bonus!</DIV>
		<DIV class="t">&nbsp;</DIV>
		<DIV class="t">You may pause the game by pressing the P key&nbsp;or the PAUSE key 
			(Windows version).</DIV>
