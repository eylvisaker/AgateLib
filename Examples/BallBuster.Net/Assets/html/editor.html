How to use the Ball: Buster level editor</div>
<div class="t">
Use the up and down stage link in the bottom left corner to find the level you want to edit (or create!). Then click the color block you'd like to place, the
 cursor will change to it's color. Now click in the play area to place a block, click and drag to place multiple. The toilet icon will erase blocks you've placed. 
When you are done editing, click the save link in the bottom left corner, it will make a noise to confirm it was saved. When you go back to the title screen, 
the game will automatically start on the last level opened in the level editor. Have fun! You can share your levels with other users at patrickavella.com
