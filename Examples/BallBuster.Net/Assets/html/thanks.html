Special Thanks</div>

Thank you to:<br>
As always, the open Source Community. They are the ones who make so much possible for a guy like me.
<br>
The ClanLib dev team, for creating one of the most fantastic pieces of software I've ever had the pleasure of using.
<br>
All of the programmers on the GD&P at GameFAQs. They've taught me and have helped me, more than I could ever repay.
<br>
My mother, for being supportive of whatever I do.
<br>
God, for everything, and I mean that.
<br>
Most of all, a big thanks to YOU, for taking the time to read this, and enjoying the game I've created. My deepest gratitude.
