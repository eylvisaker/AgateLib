This example shows how to create a basic user interface with a menu that the user can either select with the A button on the game controller, enter on the keyboard, or click/tap on.

Create a file called "Resources.yaml" which will hold the description of the menu.

A set of UI objects which are all displayed to the user at once is called a Facet. Inside the resources file you will see a single facet defined.

At the root of any facet you need windows. These objects represent an area on the screen which will contain the UI controls.
