
Version 0.2.1a
===================
* Fixed bugs in the MDX and System.Drawing drivers where an Exception was thrown if the application was minimized.

Version 0.2.1
===================
* Restructured storage for registered drivers in Registrar class to allow easier addition of new types of drivers.
* Added platform specific drivers to provide P/Invoke methods to increase speed and memory efficiency.
* Agate applications should run under Linux with a proper Mono installation now.
* Added debug messages when non-cross-platform paths are used, in particular when the backslash (\) is used as a path separator.
* Organized some of the source code in different directories.
* Registrar.Initialize is now internal instead of public.  If you are calling it, use Core.Initialize instead.
* Added a hack to make sure the Display.DeltaTime never returns zero.
* Fixed a Sprite bug where if a Clone'd sprite was Dispose'd, the shared surface data would also be disposed.  Now SpriteFrames are reference counted to resolve this.
* Fixed a bug in Sound and Music objects where they might not respond to StopAllSounds/Music.

Version 0.2.0
===================
* Added a BitmapFontImpl class, to handle bitmap fonts.
* Added FontSurface.BitmapMonospace method to create a monospace bitmap font.
* Added Surface.DrawRects, it was mistakenly missing.
* Added Keyboard.AnyKeyPressed to check to see if the user has hit a key.  
* Added StringTransformer class to allow FontSurfaces to transform strings before they are drawn.
* Added the Serializable attribute to Point, PointF, Rectangle, RectangleF, Size, SizeF structures.
* Added some code to make the Registrar a little more robust, if non .NET dll's are present.
* Added Timing.StopWatch.IsPaused as a read-only property.
* Added Object.Equals overrides in Point and Size structures.
* Added operator == and operator != in Point, Size and Rectangle structures.
* Added DisplayWindow constructor overloads that allow specification of a .ico file for the window icon.

* Renamed Keyboard.ClearAllKeys to Keyboard.ReleaseAllKeys.  Old version is there, but deprecated.
* Changed Keyboard.ReleaseAllKeys to call an internal KeyState method.
* Changed behavior of Keyboard.ReleaseAllKeys to mark keys which are already depressed so that KeyDown events are not generated for them until the are physically released.

* Fixed a bug in AgateMDX.Surface.DrawRects which was from using TriangleStrips instead of TriangleLists, and updated it to use the DrawBuffer.
* Fixed a bug where SoundBuffer and Music objects weren't using the FileManager search paths.
* Fixed a bug where Display.AutoPause would cause the program to go in an infinite loop and never exit when the window was closed.
* Fixed a bug where a NullReferenceException would occur if a new Music object was created and failed to open the media file, and then was subsequently finalized. 
* Corrected version information in AgateDrawing and AgateMDX.
* Fixed SpriteTester and SurfaceTester to work with Mono.
