Version 0.4.0
===================
Major changes in this version.

AgateLib now has built-in fonts, which can be accessed via static members like 
FontSurface.AgateSans14 for a 14-point sans serif font.  This are bitmap fonts
embedded in AgateLib.dll, and they are guaranteed to look exactly the same across
all supported platforms.

A basic set of GUI controls has been included for an in-game GUI.  This is located
in the AgateLib.Gui namespace.  This GUI has a somewhat flexible skinning engine
called Mercury.

Basic support for 3D rendering is now available.  This is accessed by using
the shaders in AgateLib.DisplayLib.Shaders.AgateBuiltInShaders class.  You can 
create vertex buffers and index buffers.

The old IRenderTarget interface that was implemented by DisplayWindows and Surfaces
is gone, and instead we have the FrameBuffer class.  This requires some rather
minor changes to consumer code, and resolves ambiguities around having surfaces
as render targets, and is much more forward compatible.

No longer are you required to create a DisplayWindow before creating any Surfaces.
Now objects can be instantiated in any order, as long as AgateSetup.Initialize has
been called.

AgateMDX has been dumped and a SlimDX based replacement, AgateSDX is included now.
SlimDX has much better community support, and AgateSDX will eventually be
developed to include Direct3D 10/11 support.

A particles system has been developed by Marcel Hauf and is included in the
AgateLib.DisplayLib.Particles namespace.

A simple mechanism for saving/loading user perferences has been implemented
in the AgateLib.Settings namespace, and is accessed through Core.Settings.

Several functions have been deprecated around the library.  A compatibility 
release versioned 0.3.9 is included which retains these deprecated functions
to help migrate code to AgateLib 0.4.0.  Not everything could be kept however.

AgateLib 0.3.1  Release Notes
======================================

This is mainly a minor update to 0.3.0.  All features deprecated in 0.3.0 have
been removed.  There are a few minor bug fixes, and a few properties added.  
Of note is the addition of the ZipFileProvider, which is an IFileProvider object
that allows resources to be loaded from zip files.

AgateLib 0.3.0  Release Notes
======================================

There are several major additions to this version of AgateLib, the most notable 
is support for MacOS X without running through X11.  To have support for MacOS
and Linux use the AgateOTK driver, which uses OpenGL as a backend.  This driver
also works on Windows, so there really is little reason to use AgateMDX any 
more.

Support for using SDL for audio and joystick input has been implemented.  This
is the recommended means of getting audio and joystick support under Linux and
MacOS.  In fact, for creating a cross-platform distribution using AgateOTK and
AgateSDL probably creates the least amount of headache.

Several parts of the API have been reorganized into separate namespaces.  For
the most part this means adding statements like "using AgateLib.DisplayLib" to
your source files.  A lot of things have been deprecated in this release, and 
shortly following the release of 0.3.0 there will be a release of 0.3.1 which 
removes all deprecated features.

Most of the testing on Linux and Mac OS X for this release has been done under 
Mono 2.0 and 2.2.  Everything should probably work on older versions of Mono, 
down to 1.2.6 maybe.  Ubuntu includes Mono 1.9.1 which seems to work well but
has not been thoroughly tested.

AgateLib 0.2.5  Release Notes
======================================

AgateLib is much more compatible with Linux now.  An OpenGL driver has been written which should get
similar performance to the Direct3D driver.  This driver should work  on Windows and Linux with 
Mono version 1.1.16 or newer.  Unfortunately, Mono version 1.1.13.8 seems to be what's available 
in the package managers in a lot of Linux distributions.  So if your version of Mono is older than
that, you must download a newer version.  I've had best luck with installing Mono as a regular user,
_not_ as root.

Some issues may not be resolved in running full-screen apps on Linux.  In particular, going full-screen 
depends on the presence of the XFree86 video mode extension.  This doesn't appear to be installed on 
all machines, or worse, it may have different names (libXxf86vm.so or libXxf86vm.so.1 so far) on 
different machines.  I am searching for a full-screen solution which does not rely on this extension, 
as there are other minor issues as well.

Cross-platform audio is supported through the use of the FMOD library.  If you wish to distribute FMOD with
your application, you must be aware that FMOD has license restrictions on distribution.  A license to distribute
FMOD can be obtained from http://www.fmod.org/ .  At the time of this writing, there are several license options
available for FMOD, including a special license for distributing software which is free (as in beer).

AgateLib now uses bitmap fonts.  Bitmap fonts are generated from a System.Drawing.Font object.  At the moment the
way these fonts look is platform dependent, and it seems that either Mono or X11 does not generate fonts which 
look quite as nice as they do on Windows.  However, this is still an improvement over the previous method of
creating fonts.  In the future, there will be a code model for generating a bitmap font on one platform and
saving it to disk to distribute to other platforms.

Support for reading and writing surface data is included now in the PixelBuffer class.  The PixelBuffer
class provides basically an array of bytes to work with.  There are also several wrapper methods to help read/write
pixels as well as conversion routines to convert from one pixel format to another.

To increase compatibility for authoring-tool type applications, the System.Drawing replacement classes are 
now moved to a different namespace.  For updating an existing Agate application which does not use any
System.Drawing calls, you only need to insert a using statement (Imports in VB) for the AgateLib.Geometry
namespace at the top of each source file.  This still doesn't have the level of compatibility I want, because
AgateLib.dll still has a reference to System.Drawing.  In a future version of AgateLib, conversion routines 
for working with System.Drawing classes will be moved into a separate class, in a separate assembly.

The ability to create lighting effects is now available.  This is not supported by the System.Drawing driver.
You create Light objects, add them to a LightManager object, and call its DoLighting method.  It can create 
some neat effects.

Known Issues:
* 16-bit display formats are not supported.
* Joysticks are not supported in Linux.
* Using a surface as a render target in OpenGL is slow, because rendering occurs in the framebuffer and then 
the pixels are copied to the surface.
* Mono on Windows is not supported.  It hasn't been tested, so I have no idea if it works or not.

Thanks to:
* Apviper, for his diligent testing efforts when I was trying to figure out how to get this to work on other machines
* Skel1 for writing Ball: Buster in C++ in the first place and introducing me to ClanLib.
* Ravuya for help with making Agate work on Mac OS X.

AgateLib 0.2.1  Release Notes
======================================

AgateLib applications should run under Linux now.  I have successfully tested them using the 
Mono VMWare SuSE image on my computer.  Unfortunately, this is the limit to my ability to test
on Linux at the moment.  The serious development of an OpenGL driver is postponed until the next
version of Tao, so hardware support under Linux will not be available until then.

Windows platform-specific P/Invoke methods have been moved to the AgateWindows.dll assembly.
This was required for Linux support.  Using AgateWindows.dll should provide a speed-up and
greater memory efficiency by providing access to PeekMessage and high-resolution timers.
This benefit may be negligible; more testing needs to be done.

The source code has been restructured a bit.  In the version 0.2.2 the System.Drawing replacement
structures Color, Point, PointF, Rectangle, RectangleF, Size, SizeF will be moved to the AgateLib.Geometry
namespace.  You can prepare for this by adding a using statement for this namespace now.  This change
will help prevent naming conflicts which occur when mixing Windows.Forms components with AgateLib.
This should not be an issue for game applications, but it is an issue for tools.  

The resource classes ResourceManager and Resource have been moved to the AgateLib.Resources 
namespace.

Display.DeltaTime will now never return zero, so it's safe to divide by it.  However, due to the nature
of this hack, if a high resolution platform-dependent timer is unavailable (such as the one in AgateWindows),
this will cap your framerate at whatever the resolution of System.Environment.GetTickCount() is.
On my test machine, this is 64 fps.

Known Issues:
* No hardware acceleration support in Mono.
* Playing .mid files as music won't play more than one.  In the future, the implementation will probably switch to FMOD instead of DirectX.AudioVideoPlayback.



AgateLib 0.2.0  Release Notes
======================================

Deployment issues, I think are resolved.  In order to develop with AgateLib, it is recommended
that you have a .NET 2.0 development environment (such as Visual C# Express 2005 or SharpDevelop 2.0).
If you are developing a game, your game only needs references to mscorlib, System.DLL, and AgateLib.dll.
No reference to System.Drawing.dll or System.Windows.Forms.dll is required.

If you're developing a game authoring tool, your application should be developed using System.Windows.Forms.
You can develop an application with a rich user interface and instruct AgateLib to render to multiple 
child controls by creating DisplayWindows for each of those controls and changing the Display.RenderTarget
to them.

If you want to deploy an application using AgateLib, of course you need to make sure that a client machine
has the .NET 2.0 framework installed.  At the moment, the only hardware acceleration supported is provided by
Managed DirectX.  As such you must also make sure that the client machine has the DirectX 9.0c runtime
install.  The files required for the June 2006 MDX update are in the dxredist folder in the AgateLib source
trunk.  These must also be installed on the client machine.  This can be done silently during the setup procedure
according to Microsoft.

Known Issues:
* Doesn't run under Linux right now.
* No hardware acceleration support in Mono.



AgateLib 0.1.8 Release Notes
======================================

Requires .NET 2.0 or Mono.

Deployment procedure, with respect to DirectX runtime files is unknown at the moment.  I 
have included what I think is the minimum required files for the DirectX runtime distributable
to work with the AgateMDX library in the dxredist directory of the archives.

Known Issues:
* VSync is not properly supported in the Direct3D driver.
* There's a problem with Display.PackAllSurfaces where it does not copy surfaces correctly.
* Direct3D driver does not work with Mono.  If you are running in Mono, delete AgateMDX.dll from your application directory.
