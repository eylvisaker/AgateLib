Goals for 0.3.5
---------------------------------------------------
	High priority
		* Display plug-in for XNA.
		* Audio plug-in for XNA.
		* Input plug-in for XNA.
		* SDL plugins for GP2X support.
		* Make AgateLib.dll depend only on routines which are available in the XNA framework.
		* Unified joystick input system
		Fully support platforms:

			* GP2X 

	Medium priority
		* Convert AgateMDX to use SlimDX instead and deprecate the use of AgateMDX.
		* Interface to allow audio to be generated at runtime.
		* Convert AgateOTK to use vertex buffers instead of vertex arrays.
		Gui

			* Document GUI classes
			* Develop data-driven skinning system for the GUI
		

Low Priority
------------
	General
		* Improve Icon

		* Experimental interfaces for vertex buffers and textures (surfaces?).
		* Shader / vertex buffer support.
		* Make 15/16 bit screen resolutions work
		* Test 15/16 bit Pixel Buffers
		* Flesh out documentation on method parameters throught the library.
		
		* Find a reliable way to detect if running on OS X.
		
		* Find or get platform specific ways to hide the mouse cursor (Needed for X11?)
		* Research Zip libraries for SearchPath class.
		* Speed up the GUI classes by prerendering controls to a surface.
		* Provide overrides for Surface, Sprite and Display to use Vector2.
		* Z-ordering for Surfaces and Sprites

		* Full screen window creation with a specified icon.
		* Save surfaces in AgateMDX so that they can be recreated if the device is lost.
		* SDL driver for GP2X support, plus audio and joystick support on other platforms
	Fonts
		* Fix italic fonts
		* Add a StringTransformer derived class which provides language file lookups.
	Sprites
		* Test gradients with sprites, and calculate correct corner colors.
