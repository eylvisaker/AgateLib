AgateLib 0.1.8 Release Notes
======================================

Requires .NET 2.0 or Mono.

Deployment procedure, with respect to DirectX runtime files is unknown at the moment.  I 
have included what I think is the minimum required files for the DirectX runtime distributable
to work with the AgateMDX library in the dxredist directory of the archives.

Known Issues:
* VSync is not properly supported in the Direct3D driver.
* There's a problem with Display.PackAllSurfaces where it does not copy surfaces correctly.
* Direct3D driver does not work with Mono.  If you are running in Mono, delete AgateMDX.dll from your application directory.
