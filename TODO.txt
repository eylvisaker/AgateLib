AgateLib Todo
=============

Goals for 0.3.1
--------------------------------
	General
		D Remove all deprecated stuff from AgateLib.
		D Remove dependency on System.Drawing and System.Windows.Forms from AgateLib.dll.
		* Add ability for ReportError to suppress errors below a certain level.
	Display
		D Implement method to choose sampling method for scaled surfaces (nearest, bilinear, etc.)
	Surfaces
		D Fix bug with rotation where ScaleWidth or ScaleHeight are less than zero.
	Drivers
		* Update AgateOTK to not call GL functions in finalizers.
	Input
		* Add support for POV hats on joysticks.

Goals for 0.3.5
---------------------------------------------------
	High priority
		* Display plug-in for XNA.
		* Audio plug-in for XNA.
		* Input plug-in for XNA.
		* SDL plugins for GP2X support.
		* Unified joystick input system
		Fully support platforms:
			* Xbox 360
			* Mac OS X
			* GP2X 

	Medium priority
		* Convert AgateMDX to use SlimDX instead and deprecate the use of AgateMDX.
		* Interface to allow audio to be generated at runtime.
		* Convert AgateOTK to use vertex buffers instead of vertex arrays.
		Gui
			* Document GUI classes
			* Develop data-driven skinning system for the GUI

Low Priority
------------
	General
		* Improve Icon
		* Experimental interfaces for vertex buffers, textures (surfaces?) and shaders.
		* Shader / vertex buffer support.
		* Make 15/16 bit screen resolutions work
		* Test 15/16 bit Pixel Buffers
		* Flesh out documentation on method parameters throught the library.
				
		* Speed up the GUI classes by prerendering controls to a surface.
		* Provide overrides for Surface, Sprite and Display to use Vector2.
		* Z-ordering for Surfaces and Sprites

		* Full screen window creation with a specified icon.
		* Save surfaces in AgateMDX so that they can be recreated if the device is lost.
		* SDL driver for GP2X support, plus audio and joystick support on other platforms
	Fonts
		* Fix italic fonts
		* Add a StringTransformer derived class which provides language file lookups.
	Sprites
		* Test gradients with sprites, and calculate correct corner colors.

Supplemental Projects
---------------------------------------------------
	Compact Sprites Builder:
		Utility to construct packed sprite files with an associated xml 
		resource file describing frame locations.
	Fonts:
		Utility to construct fonts from System.Drawing from options specified.
	Distributions:
		Builds distributions for Linux, Windows, and MacOS based on the assemblies and resource
		file(s), with possible support for localization.
