----- RPG GUI contruction kit v1.0 -----

Made by Lamoot, released under CC-BY 3.0, all images used in the process are self made or from public domain sources.

--------------------------------------

You can use it to put together different combinations of RPG-styled GUIs. Instead of offering specific widgets, I made this set so anyone can construct their GUI the way the like it. Granted, some additional ornaments wouldn't hurt. Perhaps in v2.0?
