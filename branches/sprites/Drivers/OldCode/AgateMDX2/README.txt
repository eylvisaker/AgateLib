AgateLib Managed DirectX 2.0 beta driver.

This entire set of code is deprecated, since Microsoft deprecated MDX 2.0 beta in favor of the XNA framework.  This code should not be used for further development.  The current Managed DirectX 1.1 is more mature, and should be used as a starting point for any further development.
